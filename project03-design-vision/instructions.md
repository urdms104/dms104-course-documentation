# Project 3: Design Vision

*Due: Thursday, April 29, 2021*

This assignment, Project 3, is worth 15% of your overall grade for this course. For this assignment, you will create a presentation and deliver it as a team.

Think of the *Design Vision* as **your book of rules** that you’ll use when you design the actual product in the next and final section of the course. And remember, the rules you present must be related to information you pulled together in your U&DA document.

In our book, *Design for the Digital Age*, the Design Vision is based on the instruction from these chapters:

- Framework (Chapters 15, 16)
- Design Language (Chapters 17, 18)

## Delivery

- Everyone in the team *should* deliver at least part of the presentation for which they'll be graded.  It works out better that way.  However, a team can decide that only one or some of the team members will speak.
- Regardless of who delivers the presentation, each speaker must start with the following:
  - Introduction - themselves and their role (and if other team members are not speaking, they must be introduced too)
  - Specific design aspects for which they're responsible, and the part(s) of this presentation they created 

- Note: team members with overlapping roles can present together, so long as they identify up-front that they're doing so

## Presentation Structure

NOTE: the following sections are described in detail in Chapter 19, in the book, starting with *Crafting the Story* on page 517. You can follow what's described in those pages keeping in mind: you are working on a much smaller project and you don't have to go into as much detail as they do in the book, especially when the book refers to the number of slides. You need to do what makes sense for the content you have.

-  The presentation must follow **normal formatting practices** for college-level work: readable typography, proper line spacing, et cetera. Poorly formatted presentations, spelling mistakes, or anything that makes the slides difficult to read will result in a reduced grade for the Team Lead.
-  The presentation should contain the sections shown below, clearly delineated with the following headings.
  - The team roles listed there are suggestions only
  - The sub-bullets are shown here for your understanding only
  - You are free to change or re-interpret these sections and/or the lists in the book as you see fit, based on the specifics of the information you need to present
-  The presentation needs to be 15 minutes long (+/- about a minute)

## Sections

-  **Project Summary and Expectations** (Team Lead)
  - This is where you re-introduce your product and what it will do.
  - Here you can bring up ongoing concerns and issues (if any) that impact the design.
-  **Key Personas and Requirements** (Team Lead)
  - This is a short re-statement of the personas and requirements you created from the U&DA
  - Do *not* just copy and paste all your personas and requirements from the U&DA; include only things from the U&DA that strongly influenced the Design Vision.
-  **Big Ideas and Major Anatomy**, a.k.a. the *Interaction Framework* (Interaction Designer)
  - Focus on the interaction framework chosen (typical choices were listed in Chapter 15) and why.
  - List data objects and functional needs (remember: nouns and verbs) and highlight where they come into play in the framework. This comes mostly from the U&DA but the Interactive Designer(s) need to tie it together with their framework choices.
  - Introduce the Interaction Design Anatomy. Think of this section as wire frame interface(s) with general descriptions of each major part.
    - Remember to use *unrealistic* imagery. Wireframes, sketches, et cetera. You are writing rules for design, not the actual design itself.
-  **Scenario Storyboards** (IxD or IxDG and IxDS)
  - This is, in effect, a visual and descriptive walk-through of the "play"
  - Each walk-through is referred to as a "key path" - make sure you use the correct terminology as you write-up the scenario storyboards. (Google: *storyboards* if you're unfamiliar with that term)
-  **How the Design Serves Persona Needs** (VisD)
  - Make sure you tie the key paths back to each persona need. Be specific, referring to the exact language used in the U&DA as much as possible.
-  **Design Language(s)** (VisD and ID)
  - Introduce the Form Factor design requirements. (This would come from the **Industrial Designer**.)
  - This section lists the design choices for the interface and physical component(s) as defined by the both the **Visual Designer** and **Industrial Designer**. (Remember the example documents from *First Niagara Bank*.)
  - Remember: the design language is not the actual design of the product. You can use example parts of the product in your design language but only where necessary so you can have something to show. Generally, it's better to simply list fonts, colors, shapes, et cetera AND (most importantly) what from the U&DA drove those decisions.

NOTE: not all sections described in the book are required. You are only required to write-up the sections as shown above.  Also, feel free to add or deviate from these sections (above) as you see fit because you believe you can relate the Design Vision better, in some other way.

### Colophon

-  The last slide of the presentation file needs to list who worked on the design team, their roles, and a short description of their contribution to this the Design Vision Presentation

## Advice

This cannot be said enough: the book is a template for everything we’re doing in this course. In many cases, you can simply look in the book to figure out how to write and format your presentation. Steal shamelessly! Don’t try to reinvent the wheel.

## Submission in Blackboard

*One team member* (typically the Team Lead) needs to turn-in the presentation file(s) in Blackboard. In our DMS 104 section, look in the Assignments area for "**Project 3: Design Language**"
