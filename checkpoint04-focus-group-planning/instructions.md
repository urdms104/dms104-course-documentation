# Checkpoint 4: Focus Group Planning

*Due: 24 hours before your team's focus group which must be conducted before Tuesday, March 16, 2021*

Each city-team needs to write and submit a plan (a document) and get it approved *before* conducting their focus group. You need to **work as a team** on this!

## Team Suggestions

Typically it's the **Team Lead** that needs to setup and then corral the rest of the team on this.  

Suggestions:

- Using Slack and Google Docs, establish a new shared Google Doc and add all team members **and Professor Kostin** as editor
- Setup the document like a typical college-level paper that you'd turn-in for a grade
  - Include your team's city name, the date, the design-project you're working on, and everyone's name in the team, etc.
  - Create a document outline with headings
  - Make sure you use good grammar and spelling

## Requirements

The goal of this document is to layout everything your team needs to know and do during your focus group event.  

### Goal(s)

- What is/are the goal(s) of the focus group event?  I.e. from a high level, what do you need to learn from the participants by the time the focus group ends?
- Describe the goal(s) in terms of frustrations, concerns, points-of-pride ...anything that describes emotion that you want to learn from the participants
- Describe *routines* - processes that the participants follow, if applicable, that you want to learn from the participants

### Screening

The following pertains to "user roles."  It might help to show this information in a two-column data table.

- What are the characteristics of the participants you want in the focus group?  Define the participants in terms of anything important: demographics; attitudes; behaviors; skill sets; etc.

- And when you have actual names of participants, add their names associated with the user roles you've  identified

### Meeting Outline

Before the focus group event, the team needs to decide who will do what.  Write all this in the planning document.

- Who will be the **moderator**?
  - Usually one person works best, but you can decide to change moderators to indicate different topics to be discussed; it's up to you
- Who will be the "**scribe(s)**"
  - Someone (or more than one person) should take notes live as the event progresses
  - Scribes can be active in the focus group, asking for clarification as needed, and reading-back interesting comments from time to time, for emphasis
  - NOTE: the most important thing to come out of focus groups (and individual interviews, later) are quotes - things that participants said, verbatim, that represent what a lot of people are thinking and feeling ...so always be listening for them!
- Who will be the **A/V technician**?
  - Someone will have to make sure the technical aspects of the focus group event is working as necessary; even though technology sometimes fails us, if something screws-up ...it's your fault!  (Hint: plan backups!)
  - Suggestion: PRACTICE all the following before the event!
  - Monitor the Chat (if used); save the text from the Chat if relevant
  - Make sure the event is recorded.  Zoom will create a video file on the host's desktop. Someone has to make sure the file is created and that it works as expected (BTW - if anything was written in the Chat, it'll be saved in a text file along with the video file)
  - Someone has to upload the captured video file to Panopto in our [DMS 104 Assignments folder](https://rochester.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx#folderID=%22f1e7601b-67b6-4515-8239-acc900f4e872%22) (in Settings, name the recording after your City-Team and the words "Focus Group")

The following will act as your written agenda for the actual focus group event, complete with instructions and notes for yourselves.  Use scripts to read verbatim as you see fit.

- Welcome statement
- Opening question / ice breaker
- Discussion starters - open-ended questions
  - For a half-hour focus group (which would be *extremely* short) there should be at least five of these, ready to go at any time (note: it's okay if you don't get to all of them; better to have too many than too few)
  - Also note possible *follow-up* questions depending on what types of responses you get
- Conclusion statement / wrap-up

## Turn-in for Credit

The planning document needs to be submitted AND GRADED in Blackboard 24 hours before you run the actual focus group event.  (24 hours needed in-case there are corrections or suggestions.)

The submission in Blackboard is set for *Teams* meaning only one of you (typically the Team Lead) will create the submission - and then everyone else is locked-out

NOTE: if using a Google Doc, as long as the professor is added as editor, you can just submit a link
