  - **!Naked** - AR mirror to help getting dressed ([like this, from Clueless (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/XNDubWJU0aU))
    - NOTE: this idea is identical to Team Boston's "Digital closet" (okay to proceed; you will be in competition with the other team to see who creates the better design!)
    - APPROVED, as-is!
    - Concern: the exact feature set will be a challenge to get right; also be aware of similar existing products
    - Note: you have some flexibility regarding the technology but don't get too "magical"
  - **i'mClean** - Shower caddy with features for college students
    - APPROVED - only if you come-up with a differentiator
    - Concern: the exact feature set will be a challenge to get right; also be aware of similar existing products

RESULTS: **!Naked**
