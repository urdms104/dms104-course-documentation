  - **Fight till the end** - software-based comic book that tells a sport-related story
    - NOT APPROVED - requires hardware design (something for the Industrial Designer to do); does not fulfill the DMS 104 requirements
  - **Digital big small world** - cube-shaped device with screens on each side and dedicated software on each
    - NEEDS DEFINITION - needs to be more than a six-screen'd device with undefined software
  - **Smarter Sports** - sports equipment with digital components
    - NEEDS DEFINITION - too ambiguous *...many types of equipment doing all sorts of things* needs to be narrowed down

RESULTS: **Smarter Sports**
