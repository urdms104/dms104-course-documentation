  - **Digital lipstick printer** - device that mixes and outputs lipstick according to user settings
    - NOT APPROVED - because the actual device is a closed box (unless you have to skill to actually design the inner-workings of a mini-lipstick manufacturing machine), the only design work would be the app which does not fulfill the DMS 104 requirements
  - **Digital earwax terminator** - device that removes earwax
    - NOT APPROVED - not enough interactivity; just turns on/off and then the user applies it; does not fulfill the DMS 104 requirements
  - **Digital makeup mirror** - AR mirror for applying makeup
    - APPROVED - only if you come-up with differentiators (this product already exists)
    - Concern: the exact feature set will be a challenge to get right; also be aware of similar existing products
  - **Digital closet** - AR mirror to help getting dressed
    - NOTE: this idea is identical to Team Shenzhen's "!Naked" (okay to proceed; you will be in competition with the other team to see who creates the better design!)
    - APPROVED, as-is!
    - Concern: the exact feature set will be a challenge to get right; also be aware of similar existing products
    - Note: you have some flexibility regarding the technology but don't get too "magical"

RESULTS: **Digital closet**
