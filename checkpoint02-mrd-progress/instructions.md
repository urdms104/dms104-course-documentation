# Checkpoint 2: MRD Progress

*Due: Thursday, February 18, 2021*

The point of this "checkpoint" is to provide status and get feedback on each team's Marketing Requirements Document to make sure there are no *surprises* (bad scores) when it's turned-in the following week.

*During the live discussion...*

- Each team will *informally* present their document - in whatever state it's in - and lead a discussion about the rationale for the decisions they made
- No slides necessary - it's just a discussion; but it'd be good to see the current state of your MRD document, even if it's just an outline
- Each team will have a total of **10 minutes** for their presentation and discussion

*Students unable to attend the live discussion, see the "Pre-recorded Option" section, below...*

## Suggestions

*Note: again, except for the Team Lead, the designer roles (Visual Designer, Industrial Designer, Interaction Designer) are meaningless at this time.  Everyone just needs to pull-together and work as a team.*

When in doubt about who's who, check our master list of [DMS 104 City Teams (Google Sheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GxZ4u8RjvG9D-S86QVpSdJM24KPr47ftF3mN67NC37I/edit#gid=0)

- The MRD document should exist at this point (typically created by the team lead)
- Each section in the document should be assigned to team members who are responsible its content
  - Note: in addition to the sections as outlined in the book, there is supposed to be an introduction  that describes the idea generally, so a total of *eight* sections
- Each team member should have a good sense of what their section(s) are about and have a general idea of how it applies to their chosen project idea
  - NOTE: it's okay for team members to be *stuck* or confused about their section; in that case they should still know the topic well enough to ask questions during the meeting on Thursday; we'll discuss it and hopefully answer all questions then

## Pre-recorded Option...

- Students unable to attend the live discussion must provide a short video recording (**up to about three minutes**) of themselves presenting current thoughts about their assigned sections of the MRD.
  - Just like the live discussion, it's okay to ask questions as part of the video
- Pre-recorded videos may be audio only; make sure the audio is clear and understandable
- Pre-recorded videos must be uploaded to Panopto (link below) *before* the live discussion on Thursday, February 18 at 12:30 PM EST
- Pre-recorded videos will be played live during the meeting on Thursday so we can discuss the recording and answer questions in real-time; responses to each video can be seen later in the recording of the live discussion

To use the *pre-recorded option*, upload your recording to our: [DMS 104 Panopto Assignments Folder](https://rochester.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx#folderID=%22f1e7601b-67b6-4515-8239-acc900f4e872%22) before Thursday, February 18 at 12:30 PM EST

## Grading

For this checkpoint, there is nothing to turn-in on Blackboard - simply be in attendance at our live discussion on Thursday, February 18, or have turned-in a pre-recorded video by then.

Even though you must work as a team for this checkpoint, everyone will be graded as individuals.

This checkpoint assignment is simply: **pass/fail**

The particulars of what you present and discuss, and any questions you ask will not be graded.  But students who seem unprepared will not get a passing grade.

- The Team Lead is required to have created and outlined the team's MRD document (any format) by this time, and assigned sections to the other team members
- Each student is required to have a sense of what their assigned MRD sections are about
- Each student is required to be able to relate their team's product idea to the MRD section for which they're responsible; even if there is some confusion (that's the point of discussing it!)
- If a student has questions about their section(s), they should still understand it well enough to be able to phrase specific questions; i.e. you can be totally unaware (that would indicate you were unprepared)
