# Checkpoint 6: Report Other Research Methods

*Due: anytime before you start your "Other Research Methods" which need to be completed by Thursday, April 1, 2021*

**Purpose:** 

- To keep everyone focused on what they need to do for each *Other Research Method* they plan to do
- To allow the professor a chance to spot opportunities to make suggestions (and help out if possible)

Each city-team needs to write and submit a plan (a document) and get it submitted in Blackboard.  You need to **work as a team** on this!

## Requirements

- Refer to our [DMS 104 City Teams Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GxZ4u8RjvG9D-S86QVpSdJM24KPr47ftF3mN67NC37I/edit#gid=0) to see which two "Other Sources" your team agreed to do
  - For teams that picked three, it's understood that the third choice is *your option*, meaning: you can do it if you choose, but if need be you can just rely on your first two choices
- Create a document (like a Google Doc, or whatever your choice); add the usual college-level document information at the top (Team name, members, name of this assignment, date, etc.)
- In the document, create two (or optionally three) sections - one for each of your chosen *other sources*
  - Card sorting
  - Competitive analysis
  - Diary
  - Literature and media
  - Public-space observation
  - Survey
- Under each section, fulfill the following requirements, based on your selections...

### Card sorting

Since your team has chosen CARD SORTING as one of your other research methods, answer these questions in the document:

- What is the SPECIFIC goal you want to learn from having users do a card sorting exercise?  Include in your answer: if you will be looking for (a) relationships; (b) order; or (c) both?

- What words or phrases do you plan to put on the cards? (provide a draft list)

- Who do you plan to have do the card sorting exercise and how do you plan to get them to do it?  

Also, IF you're going to use some online solution to do the card sorting exercise (you can Google to find them), provide a link to it


### Competitive analysis

Since your team has chosen COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS as one of your other research methods, answer these questions in the document:

- What are the competitive products you plan to analyze

- What are the key features that competitive products have that you plan to improve upon with your own product?


### Diary

Since your team has chosen DIARY as one of your other research methods, answer these questions in the document:

- What are the triggers for action that would trigger your diary-keepers to write something down?

- What are the types of things you expect your diary-keepers to write?

- How long do you need your diary-keepers to keep their diary? And do you have an expectation about how many diary entries you'll get?


### Literature and media

Since your team has chosen LITERATURE AND MEDIA as one of your other research methods, answer these questions in the document:

- What is (or are) the area of study that you need to learn about? And what are you expecting to learn (generally)?

- Besides Googling for information, are there any other resources you plan to use to learn about the area of study you're targeting?  I.e., talk to a subject matter expert? ...anything else?


### Public-space observation

Since your team has chosen PUBLIC-SPACE OBSERVATION as one of your other research methods, answer these questions in the document:

- Where do you plan to perform your public-space observation, and what do you hope to observe?

- How long do you need your make your observations? And do you have an expectation about how many occurrences of the targeted behavior you'll see?

SUGGESTION: if possible, record video of the behavior you're looking to spot and share it in Panopto. (Don't put yourself at risk, and don't embarrass yourself doing the recording!)


### Survey

Since your team has chosen SURVEY as one of your other research methods, answer these questions in the document:

- what is the SPECIFIC goal(s) you want to learn from having users fill out a survey? 

- what questions do you plan to put in the survey? (provide a draft of the questions)

- Who do you plan to have fill-out the survey and how do you plan to get them to do it?

## Also Note...

If your team would like to CHANGE your choice(s) of other research methods, you can do that, but let the professor know as soon as possible.

## Turn-in for Credit

The submission in Blackboard is set for *Teams* meaning only one of you (typically the Team Lead) will create the submission - and then everyone else is locked-out

NOTE: if using a Google Doc, as long as the professor is added as editor, you can just submit a link
