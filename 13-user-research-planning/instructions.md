# User Research Planning

*Due: before you start your individual interviews which are due to be completed on **Tuesday, March 23***

NOTE: as far as a plan goes, there is nothing to turn-in for this activity, but you can use this instruction sheet to prepare for your *Individual User Interviews*.

## Requirements

- **Everyone** on each team must complete at least **FOUR *individual user interviews*** 

  - The total number of interviews for each *team of four* is 16 (minimum); *teams of three*: 12 (minimum)
  - More than your minimum number of interviews is always better, if possible; in a real-world scenario your team would be required to do dozens of interviews

- **Review** how to complete a successful user interview by reviewing:

  - **Chapter 6: Planning User Research** ...about setting up and preparing for user interviews, and:
  - **Chapter 7: Understanding Potential Users and Customers** ...about conducting user interviews

- **Coordinate with your team** (usually lead by the Team Lead) to decide:

    - Who are your target **user roles (types)**? (from Chapter 6, Step 1)

    - **How many** of each type *should* you interview? (from Chapter 6, Step 2,3,4,5)

        - The number of interviews you *should* conduct per role will probably give you a high number anywhere between four, eight, or up to 16 (or more!).  You don't have to actually do that number of interviews BUT that will indicate where your team should focus its attention *instead* of focusing on all user roles evenly
        - For DMS 104, the number of *base* user roles (types) is typically two or three, and for each role typically you'll need to do FOUR interviews, minimum
        - Feel free to expand the number of interviews per user role - beyond four - based on advice from Chapter 6

    - SUGGESTION: create a shared Google Document with a table - something like this...

      | User Role                                                    | Targeted Interviewee               | Interviewer               |
      | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
      | *one row for each interview that needs to be conducted, e.g...* Athlete 1 | *person's name, contact info here* | *team member's name here* |
      | Athlete 2                                                    |                                    |                           |
      | Athlete 3                                                    |                                    |                           |
      | Athlete 4                                                    |                                    |                           |
    | *...and so on...*                                            |                                    |                           |
      
- REQUIRED: for each team, **Professor Kostin** must be one of your targeted interviewees
  - You can have him perform any role you want - just give him some advanced notice
  - Decide which team member will interview Professor Kostin and setup the interview time using<br>[**Calendly** (select "Business Meeting" so we have enough time)](https://calendly.com/rkostin)
    - Be sure to write-in where it says, "**To what regard is this meeting?**" say,<br>`DMS 104 - <your city team name>, User Interview` and briefly state what *user role* you want the professor to play

### Conduct the Interviews

- **Everyone** needs to schedule and complete their minimum FOUR user interviews by: **Tuesday, March 23** 
- Recommended: take notes and RECORD the interview as described in Chapter 7
  - Advice from Chapter 7: *"Ask permission in a casual way for any recording but—if you can do so—reassure the interviewee that you won’t be sharing the notes or recording with anyone else outside your team. You’ll probably want to take photos, but people are usually more receptive if you bring this up later in the interview. Finally, give the interviewee the chance to ask any questions before you get started."*
  - If using Zoom, remember to click the Record button, then save the MP4 file, or record the audio of your conversation using your phone
  - Later, upload your recording to [our new DMST 104 Student Projects folder in Panopto](https://rochester.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx#folderID=%2249b042bd-82bb-4b9a-85f8-acec011bd1ff%22)
    - Create sub-folders and move your files around as you see fit

***Remember: later you'll be asked to submit your notes and video/audio files in Blackboard, for credit***
