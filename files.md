## Ideation Presentations

Inventions - ideas for potential design work, presented on Tuesday, February 9, 2021

- [Shenzhen (PPTX)](files/ideation-shenzhen.pptx) ([Panopto](https://rochester.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=b9a1b029-266d-43aa-abfd-acca013cd769&start=2768.727))
  - **!Naked** - AR mirror to help getting dressed ([like this, from Clueless (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/XNDubWJU0aU))
    - NOTE: this idea is identical to Team Shenzhen's "!Naked" (okay to proceed; you will be in competition with the other team to see who creates the better design!)
    - APPROVED, as-is!
    - Concern: the exact feature set will be a challenge to get right; also be aware of similar existing products
    - Note: you have some flexibility regarding the technology but don't get too "magical"
  - **i'mClean** - Shower caddy with features for college students
    - APPROVED - so long as you come-up with a differentiator
    - Concern: the exact feature set will be a challenge to get right; also be aware of similar existing products
- [New York (PPTX)](files/ideation-new-york.pptx) ([Panopto](https://rochester.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=b9a1b029-266d-43aa-abfd-acca013cd769&start=2014.3989984))
  - **Digital VR Treadmill** - Treadmill with VR headset
    - APPROVED - so long as you include the VR equipment
    - Concern: the VR equipment could be very dangerous if not designed properly - safety features will be required; also regarding the other features, be aware of similar products already in existence
- [Toronto (PPTX)](files/ideation-toronto.pptx) ([Panopto](https://rochester.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=b9a1b029-266d-43aa-abfd-acca013cd769&start=1177.482))
  - **Fight till the end** - software-based comic book that tells a sport-related story
    - NOT APPROVED - requires hardware design (something for the Industrial Designer to do); does not fulfill the DMS 104 requirements
  - **Digital big small world** - cube-shaped device with screens on each side and dedicated software on each
    - NEEDS DEFINITION - needs to be more than a six-screen'd device with undefined software
  - **Smarter Sports** - sports equipment with digital components
    - NEEDS DEFINITION - too ambiguous *...many types of equipment doing all sorts of things* needs to be narrowed down
- [Boston (PPTX)](files/ideation-boston.pptx) [(Panopto)](https://rochester.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=7462863c-8b84-44c3-b6ca-acca00fe7ac6)
  - **Digital lipstick printer** - device that mixes and outputs lipstick according to user settings
    - NOT APPROVED - because the actual device is a closed box (unless you have to skill to actually design the inner-workings of a mini-lipstick manufacturing machine), the only design work would be the app which does not fulfill the DMS 104 requirements
  - **Digital earwax terminator** - device that removes earwax
    - NOT APPROVED - not enough interactivity; just turns on/off and then the user applies it; does not fulfill the DMS 104 requirements
  - **Digital makeup mirror** - AR mirror for applying makeup
    - APPROVED - so long as you come-up with differentiators (this product already exists)
    - Concern: the exact feature set will be a challenge to get right; also be aware of similar existing products
  - **Digital closet** - AR mirror to help getting dressed
    - NOTE: this idea is identical to Team Shenzhen's "!Naked" (okay to proceed; you will be in competition with the other team to see who creates the better design!)
    - APPROVED, as-is!
    - Concern: the exact feature set will be a challenge to get right; also be aware of similar existing products
    - Note: you have some flexibility regarding the technology but don't get too "magical"

  - **Wireless Table charger** - large touch-sensitive, table mounted device with interactivity
    - APPROVED - so long as you come-up with more features to have it interact with objects on its surface (not just charging devices)
    - Concern: the exact feature set will be a challenge to get right; also be aware of similar existing products
  - **Digital Plant Care Taker** - device inserted into the soil next to potted plants that helps take care of the plant
    - APPROVED - so long as you come-up with differentiators (this product already exists)
    - Concern: the exact feature set will be a challenge to get right; also be aware of similar existing products
    - Suggestion: big opportunity by combining features of existing products into one
  - **AI Kitchen Helper- DigiChef?** - counter-top device to help with cooking/preparing meals
    - APPROVED - as-is!
    - Concern: the exact feature set will be a challenge to get right

  - **Smart Alarm Clock** - device: alarm clock with extra features to assist user waking up
