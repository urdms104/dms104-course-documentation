# Project 4: Form & Behavior Specification (F&BS)

*Due: Friday, May 14, 2020 (end of exams week)*

This assignment brings together your city-team's **Marketing Requirements Document (MRD, Project 1)**, **User & Domain Analysis (U&DA, Project 2)**,  **Design Vision (Project 3)** and compiles it into your Detailed Design called the  **Form & Behavior Specification (F&BS, Project 4)**.

For this assignment, you will work as a team.  Specific roles and responsibilities for who writes which parts should be understood by now, and clear instructions and management should be provided by the team lead.

## Requirements

The F&BS is a document that describes every interaction, and every visual and physical (industrial) aspect of the product.  It needs to have enough specific information so engineers could use it to build a working prototype.  *(Note: this, in effect, would be what you will do as part of your DMS Capstone Project.)*

In our book, *Design for the Digital Age*, the F&BS is based on the instruction from these chapters:  

- Principles and Patterns (Chapter 21)
- Process and Practices (Chapter 22)

Also note, everyone in the team must deliver at least part of the F&BS for which they'll be graded.  

### Requirements

The recommended document structure for what is supposed to be in a Form and Behavior Specification is the book (chapter 24), however, keep in mind that the book is written for large companies with lots of professional designers working full-time.  Also, you have to decide what makes sense for  *your* product design - not all the same type of tools makes sense for all products.  So for DMS 104 students: do the best you can...

- Render realistic drawings
- Create charts
- Use arrows on diagrams that explain things
- Provide explanations in short paragraphs or tables with steps and/or descriptions of things

See chapter 24 for lots of examples of various types of ways to represent product designs.  How exactly your team does that that, is up to you.  (Note: the professor will naturally tend to give higher grades to good looking, well rendered diagrams and illustrations, so do try!)

### Document Structure

The structure of the F&BS document will be based on the particulars of your product - so it'll be different for every city-team.  However, the document still needs to uphold standards:

- **Introduction page:** a general (short – about one paragraph) introduction and perhaps an image (rendering) of the product
- There needs to be clear and **appropriately named section headers** that describe each section of the document
  - Hint: never write long paragraphs of text or many paragraphs one after another in any professional report.  Break up short concise paragraphs with lots of headings and sub-headings that describe them.


- The document must follow **normal formatting practices** for college-level documents: headers, footers, typeface, line spacing, et cetera.  Poorly formatted documents, spelling mistakes, or anything that makes the document difficult to read will result in a reduced grade.

### Content Details

Every aspect of your team’s product design must be defined and presented in the the *F&BS.* It is your final deliverable for DMS 104.  

The Team Lead needs work with the rest of the team to figure-out the best way to structure the document and make sure there are full descriptions of your product in terms of:

- Its interface - every interaction (from the IxD)
- Its visual properties (from the VisD)
- Its physical properties (from the ID)

(Again, see chapter 24 for lots of examples of various types of ways to represent product designs.)

- (*Everyone's responsibility...*) Every aspect of each part of the final design must be clearly labeled and explained, not only in its function, but the rationale for why it exists.  (Note: if the professor thinks you're just making-up things, you'll lose points. Be sure to be specific regarding each design attribute.)

### Citations

- As much as possible, **tie every aspect** back to:

  - The Marketing Requirements Document (MRD)
  - The User & Domain Analysis (U&DA)
  - The Design Vision

  ...by making **citations to the specific document, section, page and/or paragraph**, throughout the Form and Behavior Specification. 

*Note: you do not have to use formal citations; just make it clear where F&BS decisions are coming from. You can use inline citations, references, footnotes, whatever makes sense.*

### Advice

This cannot be said enough: the book is a template for everything we’re doing in this course. In many cases, you can simply look in the book to figure out how to write and format your presentation.  Steal shamelessly!  Don’t try to reinvent the wheel.

## Colophon

- The last page of the document needs to list who worked on the design team, their roles, and a short description of their contribution to this document for the F&BS document.

## Submission in Blackboard

*One team member* (typically the Team Lead) needs to turn-in the document in Blackboard.

*If you use a **Google Doc***

- Be sure to share it with **rkostin@gmail.com** (because my UR email won't work)

- Then in Blackboard, just submit the URL of the document
