- Lecture: [Chapter 12 - Requirements and Context Scenarios (Panopto)](https://rochester.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=4acd10a2-f8b4-486d-af61-ad01011647e6) and ([PDF](18-requirements-scenarios/chapter12.pdf))

- Assignment:

  - **Read Chapter 12** and start working on creating a collection of **context scenarios** and a list of **requirements** with your team

  - Continue working with your team to create models:

    - one **affinity diagram** (Chapter 10)
    - **other charts and diagrams** (Chapter 10)
    - **personas** x3 (Chapter 11)

    ...get as much done as possible before Thursday when we'll start **Project 2: User & Domain Analysis** 

  *Note: it is okay to continue working on modeling (chapters 10 and 11) and requirements (chapter 12) after Thursday, but eventually all that needs to be completed so it can be incorporated into the User & Domain Analysis (document) ...a.k.a. Project 2; we'll talk about the due date for Project 2 when we meet on Thursday, April 8*
