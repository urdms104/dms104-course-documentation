  Be prepared to discuss:

  - What two (or more) *other* research methods do you guys plan to do to supplement your individual user interviews?
  - How and when do you plan to complete the research?
  - Also, if you want: we can talk about how the individual user interviews went, and I can answer any questions about that.

- Watch the recorded lecture: [Modeling and Personas (Panopto)](https://rochester.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=c544a6b5-9150-4571-9623-acf201466b65) and ([PDF](15-modeling-and-personas/chapter10-and-11-summary.pdf))

  - This recorded lecture is an overview of the next two chapters which are kinda a big deal...

- Read: **Chapter 10, Modeling (p201-226)** and **Chapter 11: Personas (p229-297)** (due: Thursday, April 1 *...a week and a half!*)

  - These two chapters are long and have lots of specific information that you'll need to know for workshops coming up!  Get started on it early.
