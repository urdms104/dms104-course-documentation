- Live Discussion:  [**Tools Workshop** (Zoom at 12:30 PM EDT)](https://rochester.zoom.us/j/97162292503?pwd=WVIzaGlvRlZaYkFjMGJjd3p3d2s3UT09)  ![:surfer:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/13.0/apple-medium/1f3c4.png)

  ALL city-teams will need to start creating renderings of their project ideas from three perspectives:

  - **Visual** ![:arrow_left:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/13.0/apple-medium/2b05-fe0f.png) typically interface screens
  - **Industrial** ![:arrow_left:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/13.0/apple-medium/2b05-fe0f.png) 3D renderings are best
  - **Interactive** ![:arrow_left:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/13.0/apple-medium/2b05-fe0f.png) this is the most difficult; how do you show changes of state during interaction?

- Students will show examples of thier handiwork via screen share
