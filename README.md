- **Design Vision Prep** ([live discussion in Zoom at 12:30 PM EDT](https://rochester.zoom.us/j/97162292503?pwd=WVIzaGlvRlZaYkFjMGJjd3p3d2s3UT09))
  - Short discussion about **Project 3: Design Vision**, due in a week (or so ...we'll need to talk about it)
  - Be prepared to **show your rough drafts** of any mock-ups, sketches, renderings ...anything, really! using whatever software you're trying out
    - Workflow sketches (for your “framework”)
    - Visual representations - interface mock-ups and 3D renderings ( for your “design language”)
