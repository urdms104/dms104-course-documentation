- Lecture: [Framework And Design Language Tools (Panopto)](https://rochester.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=44bad5f8-8342-41d5-a550-ad0b00cfa7ad) and ([PDF](22-tools-and-workshop/chapters15-19.pdf))
- Suggested: try out the software suggested last week during [Tuesday's Tools Workshop (Panopto)](https://rochester.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=1edc7197-7e3b-4b59-867c-ad09011c4c2f) plus  some of the software shown in today's lecture video
  - Start creating workflow drawings and product illustrations
- **READ: assigned chapters, 15/16 and/or 17/18** based on your role, as described in the video
  - As you read your assigned chapters work together with your team to divide and conquer based on the role you picked for yourself back in Chapter 2
  - Start gathering raw information and notes (rough drafts, mock-ups, using some of the software we talked about last week, and shown in today's lecture)
- **PREPARE:** Thursday will be a **show-and-tell** - each team will present initial renderings via Zoom
  - Workflow sketches ("framework")
  - Visual representations ("design language")
  - Keep in mind: probably everything you first draw will be thrown out, but you have to start somewhere!
