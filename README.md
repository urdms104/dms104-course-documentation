- [Project 4: Form & Behavior Specification (F&BS)](project04-fbs/instructions.md) *(due: Friday, May 14, 2020 ...end of exams week)*
  - Note: the due date for the F&BS document is more than a week and a half away!  You don't need to take all that time (Who wants to be working on this that long?) But if you need the extra time, there you have it.  Good luck üçÄ
