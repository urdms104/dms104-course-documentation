- Live Discussion/Workshop: **Modeling Workshop** (Zoom was at 12:30 PM EDT)

  - You were required to **read Chapters 10 and 11** in the book so we could "model" your data in real-time today; keep the book handy during today's workshop (you'll need it as reference)

  - Goal: create a set of **charts, diagrams, lists, and personas** that summarize everything learned from research

  - Process:

    1. Compile our research data: 
       - MRD &rarr; document (keep on-hand)
       - Stakeholder meeting notes &rarr; synthesize findings into lists of *imperatives* and *experience attributes*
       - Focus group event notes &rarr; single-case analysis; "coding"
       - Individual interview notes and artifacts &rarr; single-case analysis; "coding"
       - Other sources of information and inspiration &rarr; summarize into lists if *imperatives*
    2. Single-case Analysis &rarr; Cross-case Analysis
       - Create: Activity Diagrams; Decision Trees; Swim Lane Diagrams; Process Diagrams; etc.
       - Create: Affinity Diagram
       - For Quantitative data: Create Statistical Analysis
  3. Cross-case Analysis Continued: Personas (x3)
       1. Divide by roles
     2. Identify behavioral and demographic variables
       3. Id patterns
       4. Define goals
       5. Write narratives
  
- Assignment for next time:
  - Complete modeling - from wherever we left off (you'll need everything for Project 2)
  - Read the blue section...
      - **Chapter 12 Defining Requirements** (p299-349 ...50 pages)
      - **Chapter 13 Putting it All Together: User & Domain Analysis** (U&DA) (p352-375 ...23 pages)
          - Note: Chapter 13 is in effect, the instructions for Project 2
